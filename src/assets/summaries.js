        description:'Even before COVID-19 altered the eating environment, owning and operating a restaurant was a time-consuming and costly enterprise. The Food Truck are a unique way to bring people the food they crave while keeping your employees and customers safe. With fewer people able or choosing to dine in person — but still looking for options to save them from cooking all of their meals themselves — these food trucks are a unique way to bring people the food they crave while keeping your employees and customers safe. Food trucks are more likely to have a small menu, which means you can learn only a few choice foods and have a lot more versatility. The days you work, the hours you are open, and the place you select to park your food truck are all subject to change which brings in a lot of flexibility. Huge fixed costs can be saved. The food truck sector will be worth $996.2 million, so now is the time to get your hands on some of those dollars.'
