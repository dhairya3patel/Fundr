# Fundr

## Idea

In the current generation, where time is a very limited resource, it is very essential to have an application which will serve the purpose of matching the founders of upcoming startups with the investors in the most convenient approach. 
Our application focuses on fulfilling this purpose with the help of a card-swiping feature.  The founders will be able to post their pitch which will be displayed as cards to the investors and the investor can either left swipe to reject or right swipe to accept the match. Once there is a successful match, both the parties will be able to mutually interact with each other and go forward with the process.
