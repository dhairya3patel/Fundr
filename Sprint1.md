# Fundr â€“ Sprint 1

## Idea
In the current generation, where time is a very limited resource, it is very essential to have an application which will serve the purpose of matching the founders of upcoming startups with the investors in the most convenient approach. 
Our application focuses on fulfilling this purpose with the help of a card-swiping feature.  The founders will be able to post their pitch which will be displayed as cards to the investors and the investor can either left swipe to reject or right swipe to accept the match. Once there is a successful match, both the parties will be able to mutually interact with each other and go forward with the process.

## Framework and Tools
1.  Golang
2. ReactJs

## Focus
Sprint 1 of this project focuses on the SignUp/Login feature as well as the Home Page where the investor is able to see different cards.

## Main Tasks
1. Prepare GitHub project repository.
2. Insert ReadMe file for project description
3. Set up tools and frameworks used for application development. This includes setting up React for front-end developers and GoLang for back-end developers.
4. Create User Stories as Issues.
5. Create Sprint-1 Task Board in Projects.
6. Develop UI for Sign-In page, Sign-Up page, and Home Page for Investor.

## User Stories as Issues
1. As a registered user, I want to log in with my username and password so that the system can authenticate me and I can trust it.
2. As an investor, I want to swipe the ideas left or right based on my interests so that I can decide whether to move forward with the idea or not and view other cards in the stack.
3. As an investor, I want to view the business ideas of the founders so that I can get a detailed perspective about the idea and be able to form my decision.
4. As a new user, I want to register by creating a profile so that the system can remember me and my data.
