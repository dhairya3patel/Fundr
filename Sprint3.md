# Fundr â€“ Sprint 3

## Idea
In the current generation, where time is a very limited resource, it is very essential to have an application which will serve the purpose of matching the founders of upcoming startups with the investors in the most convenient approach. 
Our application focuses on fulfilling this purpose with the help of a card-swiping feature. The founders will be able to post their pitch which will be displayed as cards to the investors and the investor can either left swipe to reject or right swipe to accept the match. Once there is a successful match, both the parties will be able to mutually interact with each other and go forward with the process.

## Framework and Tools
1. Golang
2. ReactJs

## Focus
Sprint 3 of this project focuses on adding extra features to the website.

## User Stories as Issues
1. Feature 1: As an investor, I should be able to filter the companies on the basis of specific tags.
2. Feature 2: As a founder, I should be able to obtain the mail address of the investor on getting matched to discuss further details.
3. As a founder, I should have a page where I can write down my business idea and fill in other necessary details as well.
4. As a registered user, I want to manage my account settings.
5. As a registered user, I want to reset my password, so that I can recover access to my account.
6. As a user, I should be redirected to the correct page i.e. Founder/Investor and provide the associated functions accordingly.
7. As an investor, I can save the idea card for later if I am unsure about the decision and wish to review it later.
